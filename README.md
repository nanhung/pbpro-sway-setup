Additionally, there are two kind of **movement key** sets:

## Appendix A: Chromium with Widevine for Netflix, Spotify and Co.

As part of the Sway profile you also received a custom bash script `/usr/local/bin/install_chromium_widevine.sh`, which when executed will create a custom systemd-spawn container in `/var/lib/machines/chromium_widevine` based on Debian 10 Buster armhf. Additionally, a compatible Chromium version incl. the required DRM extensions are installed into this container. This will take some time, but when finished you are able to either launch a custom Chromium-Widevine application either via the shell (`/usr/local/bin/launch_chromium_widevine.sh`), or via the application launcher (`Chromium-Widevine`).

## Appendix B: Pinebook related tweaks

If you have the predecessor of the Pinebook Pro you will have to do the following minor tweaks on the default installation:

- for the correct battery status in Waybar you will have to update it's config (default in `$HOME/.config/waybar`) and change the value of the "bat" property in the battery section

```json
    "battery": {
        ...
        "bat": "cw2015-battery"         // <--- set to "axp20x-battery" for Pinebook
    },
```
